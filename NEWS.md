Version 2.0:
- This is a complete rewrite of Bino. All code is new and based on Qt6:
  - Builds with CMake instead of autoconf
  - Media input is handled by Qt Multimedia instead of FFmpeg and libass
  - Media output is handled by Qt abstractions instead of OpenAL, GLEW and
    plain OpenGL
  - Virtual Reality support is handled by QVR instead of Equalizer
  - Translations use Qt mechanisms instead of gettext
- New features:
  - Support for 360° videos, with and without 3D
  - Simpler and more powerful VR mode, with autodetection of SteamVR
  - Support for both desktop OpenGL and OpenGL ES
  - GPU accelerated video decoding
- Changed features:
  - Scripting commands have changed, see the manual
  - Multi-screen fullscreen now always requires VR mode, but is simple to
    set up with QVR.
  - LIRC support is not built in anymore but can be achieved by writing
    scripting commands to a named pipe
- Removed features that might be added back if there is enough interest:
  - Cropping and zooming
  - Parallax adjustment
  - Crosstalk ghostbusting
- Removed features that depend on support being added to Qt Multimedia:
  - Advanced subtitle formats
  - Separate left/right video tracks

Version 1.6.8:
- Improved support for using multiple cameras
- New options and script commands to set a vertical pixel shift

Version 1.6.7:
- Fixed a loop mode problem where the beginning of a video was skipped.

Version 1.6.5:
- Fixed a bug that prevented Bino from working correctly in some languages.

Version 1.6.4:
- Current FFmpeg libraries are supported.
- Build problems were fixed.
- A few bugs were fixed.
- Current Qt versions are supported, but "OpenGL stereo" support is disabled
  with Qt >= 5.7 until a proper fix is found.

Version 1.6.3:
- Build problems were fixed.

Version 1.6.2:

- New option to force a source aspect ratio.
- Support for newer versions of FFmpeg/Libav and Equalizer.

Version 1.4.0:
- Support for the new output mode "Left/right view alternating", also known
  as "frame sequential". This is intended for 120Hz active stereo projectors
  and displays when "OpenGL stereo" is not available.
- Better support for audio control. Volume, mute, and delay can be adjusted,
  and the output device can be selected.
- Support for scripting via script files or named pipes.
- Much improved support for older graphics cards.
- Support for video output via SDI on NVIDIA Quadro cards.
- Automatic support for high precision color input and output (30 bits per
  pixel).
